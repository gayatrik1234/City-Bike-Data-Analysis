# City-Bike-Dataset-Analysis-using-R-Programming
Data Analysis
========
*  This is the final project of Big Data and Information Systems course in my graduation. 
*  I used R studio and ArcGIS for coding and creating visualizations of the results  

**Data Source**
 https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
 Description: The dataset focuses on the information about the 400+ bike stations within New York City that was recorded from 
 July 2013 to February 2014 and it calculates nearly to 0.8 Million for a month
 
 **Statistical Analysis**
 * Finding correlation and covariance for numerical values
 * Replacing the missing values by performing regression and mean of non missing values
 
**R code**
* Built linear model to predict startimes from the average trip duration,user types and time of the week
* Analysis to determine the month in which most biking was done,most used staion and number of users with average
  trip duration and bike id

**Graphs and plots**
* Graphs showing highest number of bike usage and highest contribution towards revenue generation
* Geographical display of Start Staions using ArcGIS to determine frequently travelled locations in New York boroughs
* Scatter plots and bar graphs to determine best times for bike maintainance within a week and most used bike stations 
  for maintaining the availibility of bikes
